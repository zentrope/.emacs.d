#+DESCRIPTION: What to do when Emacs gives you trouble.


* How do I fix issues with lsp-java always wanting to rename packages?

Quit emacs, then go into =~/.emacs.d= and remove the workspace directory. When you restart, things should be better.

Also, visit build.gradle and run ~M-x lsp-java-update-project-configuration~, and make ~lsp-restart-workspace~.

* How do I add a new project to Treemacs without triggering "project already exists"?

When you enter in the path to the new project for your workspace, remove the trailing ~/~ from the path.
